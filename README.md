Part 1 (required)
1. Create database structure using Laravel migrations.
2. Fill database with fake users using Laravel seeder. Fake user data (first name, last
name and other fields) should look real (i.e not just a string with random
characters). Please generate at least 1000 fake users.
3. Implement REST API backend logic including validation and error responses for
invalid requests.
4. Host your solution on any hosting and send as the link. No need to attach domain,
url with IP address like http://<IP> is enough.
    
Part 2 (optional)
1. Create database structure first using MySQL Workbench (do not forget to commit
MySQL Workbench project file to git) and generate migration files for Laravel from
existing MySQL database or directly from MySQL Workbench project file. Commit
your MySQL Workbench project file to git to “docs” directory.
2. Create Postman project for your API which covers all resources. It should point to
the url where you hosted your solution (see Part 1 #4). Commit Postman project to
git to “docs” directory too.
